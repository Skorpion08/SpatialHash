1. Prevent creating new entities copying the EntityRecord and then destroying the original (more speed, and we like sped)
2. Simplify some code (for example the ECS::Add function it takes quite a chunk of space)
3. Make a sparse set for Entity Records it will probably be faster
4. Finish the port to NEW COLUMN
