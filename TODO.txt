1. Prevent creating new entities copying the EntityRecord and then destroying the original (more speed, and we like sped)
2. Simplify some code (for example the ECS::Add function it takes quite a chunk of space)
3. Make a sparse set for Entity Records it will probably be faster
4. Make code in physics make rb1 and rb2 point to the same shit if one of them doesnt have it
